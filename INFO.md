# Account Create

This form creates an AD account. The account can be a new employee (who is not in the HR system), a test account, or a supplier account. 

## Business Benefits

This form can create an account without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD, security is improved. Additionally, every new account is created in a standardized way.
